<Background Story>

Since I was around 10 years old, Real Estate has been one of my biggest interests.

Why?

I'm not sure to be honest, it just has been.

While learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and going through tons of tutorial videos, I thought 
building an app that had something to do with my interests would make the learning process
more enjoyable and not pull my hair out.
